      console.log(tiltRef.current);

        // That's not going to lead to any bugs but it is sub-optimal because what that means is that we're called destroy with vanilla-tilt and then we'll call init with vanilla-tilt between every render of our component.
        // We don't need to do that because none of the things in this function can change with re-renders of our tilt component.
