              When we click on removeItem, for example, if we try to remove the grape, then that goes into this code right here, which calls setItems. That sets the items to the same list of items that we had before, except we're filtering out the item that you were trying to remove.
              This call to setItems is going to trigger a re-render of our app. The app is going to come down here. We're going to create these React elements. We're going to iterate over this list of items, which now has one less item than it had before. We're going to hand that off to React so that it can update the DOM appropriately.
              The way React updates the DOM is it has a reference to the JSX elements that you gave it the last time it rendered this app component. It compares those React elements with the new React elements that you just returned at this time. Then it updates the DOM accordingly.
              When you're giving it an array of React elements, unless React has some sort of identifier to know which element is which, it doesn't know whether you removed an element or maybe you added three and removed four or maybe you changed the order and just removed the first one.
              It doesn't have any insight into what it is that you did to this array of React elements between the last time it rendered and this time. Any time you're rendering an array of React elements, you need to give it a key so that it can determine whether elements were removed, added, or modified.
              That's why providing a unique key for each one of these items is going to fix this problem.

That's because as React is comparing the previous version with the new version, what you're saying is the element that was at index four is actually now at index three, but React doesn't know that.
